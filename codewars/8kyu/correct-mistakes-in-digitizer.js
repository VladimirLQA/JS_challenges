/*
 Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts.
 Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.
 When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter),
 are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.
 Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text.
 You only have to handle the following mistakes:

 S is misinterpreted as 5
 O is misinterpreted as 0
 I is misinterpreted as 1
 The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.
